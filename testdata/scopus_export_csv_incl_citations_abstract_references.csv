The governments of these countries have been boosting their investments in research and development to become part of the group of nations doing research at a world-class level. This study investigates the development of the BRICS countries in the domain of top-cited papers (top 10% and 1% most frequently cited papers) between 1990 and 2010. To assess the extent to which these countries have become important players at the top level, we compare the BRICS countries with the top-performing countries worldwide. As the analyses of the (annual) growth rates show, with the exception of Russia, the BRICS countries have increased their output in terms of most frequently cited papers at a higher rate than the top-cited countries worldwide. By way of additional analysis, we generate coauthorship networks among authors of highly cited papers for 4 time points to view changes in BRICS participation (1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010). Here, the results show that all BRICS countries succeeded in becoming part of this network, whereby the Chinese collaboration activities focus on the US.

Particular attention is paid here to a targeted broad impact measurement: The aim is to discover the impact which a particular publication set has on specific user groups (outside research) by using altmetrics. This study used the Mendeley application programming interface (API) to download the Mendeley counts (broken down by different user types of publications in Mendeley) for a comprehensive F1000Prime data set. F1000Prime is a post-publication peer review system for papers from the biomedical area. As the F1000 papers are provided with tags from experts in this area (Faculty members) which can characterise a paper more exactly (such as ""good for teaching"" or ""new finding""), the interest of different user groups in specifically tagged papers could be investigated. This study's evaluation of the variously tagged F1000 papers provided interesting insights into the use of research papers by different user groups. The most interesting tag for altmetrics research is ""good for teaching"". This applies to papers which are well written and provide an overview of a topic. Papers with this tag can be expected to arouse interest among people who are hardly or not at all involved in research. The results of the regression models in this study do in fact show that lecturers, researchers at a non-academic institution, and others (such as librarians) have a special interest in this kind of papers. In the case of a key article in a field, or a particularly well written article that provides a good overview of a topic, then it will tend to be better received by people which are not particularly related to academic research.

The bibliometric variables are the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) of the publication medium, the numbers of authors and pages, and the statistical citedness of the references used within the paper. We find that the JIF has a larger influence on the citation impact of a publication than the quality (measured by judgments of peers). However, the number of pages and the quality of the references are less influential. The influence of JIF peaks after three years and then declines (in most regression analyses), but remains higher than the influence of quality judgments even after ten years. These results call into question a discrepancy between the algorithmically based indicators and the qualitative judgments by experts. The latter seems less predictive for future citation than a combination of algorithmic constructs. The results of this study can contribute to the empirical specification of the relevance of a normative versus a constructivist theory of citation.

Science and technology has been a primary vehicle for growing the bilateral relationship between China and the United States since the opening of relations between the two countries in the late 1970s. During the early 2000s, the scientific relationship between China and the United Statesâ€”as measured in coauthored papersâ€”showed significant growth (Jin et al. in Journal of Shanxi University 30(2):295â€“302, 2007). Chinese scientists claim first authorship much more frequently than U.S. counterparts by the end of the decade. The sustained rate of increase of collaboration with one other country is unprecedented on the U.S. side. Even growth in relations with eastern European nations does not match the growth in the relationship between China and the United States. Both countries can benefit from the relationship, but for the U.S., greater benefit would come from a more targeted strategy.

Both factors, discipline and period - have an influence on the citation count which is independent of the quality of the publication. Normalizing the citation impact of papers for these two factors started in the mid-1980s. Since then, a range of different methods have been presented for producing normalized citation impact scores. The current study uses a data set of over 50,000 records to test which of the methods so far presented correlate better with the assessment of papers by peers. The peer assessments come from F1000Prime - a post-publication peer review system of the biomedical literature. Of the normalized indicators, the current study involves not only cited-side indicators, such as the mean normalized citation score, but also citing-side indicators. As the results show, the correlations of the indicators with the peer assessments all turn out to be very similar. Since F1000 focuses on biomedicine, it is important that the results of this study are validated by other studies based on datasets from other disciplines or (ideally) based on multi-disciplinary datasets.

This paper provides an overview of research into three of the most important altmetrics: microblogging (Twitter), online reference managers (Mendeley and CiteULike) and blogging. The literature is discussed in relation to the possible use of altmetrics in research evaluation. Since the research was particularly interested in the correlation between altmetrics counts and citation counts, this overview focuses particularly on this correlation. For each altmetric, a meta-analysis is calculated for its correlation with traditional citation counts. As the results of the meta-analyses show, the correlation with traditional citations for micro-blogging counts is negligible (pooled r = 0.003), for blog counts it is small (pooled r = 0.12) and for bookmark counts from online reference managers, medium to large (CiteULike pooled r = 0.23; Mendeley pooled r = 0.51).

This study presents a proposal with which the topical connections of the institutions of an organization can be investigated through analysis of co-authorships, direct citation links, and co-citations. Based on various bibliometric data sets for an organization whose institutions are used as an example, this study illustrates the possibility of comparing the self-perception of institutions of this organization (co-authorships, direct citation links) with a view to (possible) mutual collaboration with the external perception (co-citations). This comparison is made firstly for the whole organization with the aid of network graphs; secondly, the comparison is presented in a table for a specific institution and its (possible) collaborations in the organization. Particularly the tabular breakdown of the links between the institutions can provide concrete indications of possible further collaboration between the institutions which have not yet manifested themselves in co-authorships.

However, few studies on this topic focus on elaborating the scientific performance of universities' institutions, such as institutes, schools, and faculties. For this reason, the aim of this study is to design an appropriate framework for evaluating and ranking institutions within a university. The devised methodology ranks institutions based on the number of published papers, mean normalized citation score (MNCS), and four percentile-based indicators using the I-distance method. We applied the proposed framework and scrutinized the University of Belgrade (UB) as the biggest and the best-ranked university in Serbia. Thus, 31 faculties and 11 institutes were compared. Namely, an in-depth percentile-based analysis of the UB papers indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIe) and the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) for the period 2008-2011 is provided. The results clearly show considerable discrepancies in two occasions: first, when it comes to the question of leading author, and second, when it comes to analyzing the percentile rank classes (PRs) of groups of faculties.","Bibliometrics; Faculties; I-distance; Institutes; Percentile; Percentile rank classes; Schools; Scientific output; Scientific productivity; University rankings","Abramo, G., Cicero, T., D'Angelo, C.-A., The impact of unproductive and top researchers on overall university research performance (2013) Journal of Informetrics, 7 (1), pp. 166-175. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2012.10.006; Abramo, G., D'Angelo, C.-A., Pugini, F., The measurement of Italian universities' research productivity by a non parametric-bibliometric methodology (2008) Scientometrics, 76 (2), pp. 225-244. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-007-1942-2; AcuÃ±a, E., Espinosa, M., Cancino, J., Paper-based productivity ranking of Chilean forestry institutions (2013) Bosque, 34 (2), pp. 211-219. , http://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0717-92002013000200010; Altanopoulou, P., Dontsidou, M., Tselios, N., Evaluation of ninety-three major Greek university departments using Google Scholar (2012) Quality in Higher Education, 18 (1), pp. 111-137. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13538322.2012.670918; Altbach, P., (2013) The International Imperative in Higher Education, , Rotterdam: SensePublishers; ARWU, (2014) ARWU 2014-Methodology, , http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU-Methodology-2014.html, Academic Ranking of World Universities; Barnett, B., Teaching and research are inescapably incompatible (1992) The Chronicle of Higher Education, 38 (40); Bornmann, L., How to analyze percentile impact data meaningfully in bibliometrics? the statistical analysis of distributions, percentile rank classes, and top-cited papers (2013) Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 64 (3), pp. 587-595. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.22792; Bornmann, L., Bowman, B.F., Bauer, J., Marx, W., Schier, H., Palzenberger, M., Bibliometric standards for evaluating research institutes in the natural sciences (2014) Beyond Bibliometrics, pp. 201-224. , In: Cronin, Blaise; Sugimoto, Cassidy R.

This paper provides an overview of research into three of the most important altmetrics: microblogging (Twitter), online reference managers (Mendeley and CiteULike) and blogging. The literature is discussed in relation to the possible use of altmetrics in research evaluation. Since the research was particularly interested in the correlation between altmetrics counts and citation counts, this overview focuses particularly on this correlation. For each altmetric, a meta-analysis is calculated for its correlation with traditional citation counts. As the results of the meta-analyses show, the correlation with traditional citations for micro-blogging counts is negligible (pooled r = 0.003), for blog counts it is small (pooled r = 0.12) and for bookmark counts from online reference managers, medium to large (CiteULike pooled r = 0.23; Mendeley pooled r = 0.51).

Design/methodology/approach â€“ This case study is based on a sample of 1,082 the Public Library of Science (PLOS) journal articles recommended in F1000. The data set includes altmetrics which were provided by PLOS. The F1000 data set contains tags on papers which were assigned by experts to characterise them. Findings â€“ The most relevant tag for altmetric research is â€œgood for teachingâ€�, as it is assigned to papers which could be of interest to a wider circle of readers than the peers in a specialised area. One could expect papers with this tag to be mentioned more often on Facebook and Twitter than those without this tag. The results from regression models were able to confirm these expectations: papers with this tag show significantly higher Facebook and Twitter counts than papers without this tag. This clear association could not be seen with Mendeley or Figshare counts (that is with counts from platforms which are chiefly of interest in a scientific context). Originality/value â€“ The results of the current study indicate that Facebook and Twitter, but not Figshare or Mendeley, might provide an indication of which papers are of interest to a broader circle of readers (and not only for the peers in a specialist area), and could therefore be useful for the measurement of the societal impact of research.

RPYS allows us to identify peak years in citations in a field, which promises to help scholars identify the key contributions to a field, and revolutionary discoveries in a field. We discovered that philosophy of science, a sub-field in the humanities, differs significantly from other fields examined with this method. Books play a more important role in philosophy of science than in the sciences. Further, Einsteinâ€™s famous 1905 papers created a citation peak in the philosophy of science literature. But rather than being a contribution to the philosophy of science, their importance lies in the fact that they are revolutionary contributions to physics with important implications for philosophy of science.

While peer review and bibliometrics have become standard methods for measuring the impact of research in science, there is not yet an accepted framework within which to measure societal impact. Alternative metrics (called altmetrics to distinguish them from bibliometrics) are considered an interesting option for assessing the societal impact of research, as they offer new ways to measure (public) engagement with research output. Altmetrics is a term to describe web-based metrics for the impact of publications and other scholarly material by using data from social media platforms (e.g. Twitter or Mendeley). This overview of studies explores the potential of altmetrics for measuring societal impact. It deals with the definition and classification of altmetrics. Furthermore, their benefits and disadvantages for measuring impact are discussed.

The current study seeks to answer this question with a comprehensive dataset (about 100,000 records) from very disparate sources (F1000, Altmetric, and an in-house database based on Web of Science). In the F1000 peer review system, experts attach particular tags to scientific papers which indicate whether a paper could be of interest for science or rather for other segments of society. The results show that papers with the tag ""good for teaching"" do achieve higher altmetric counts than papers without this tag - if the quality of the papers is controlled. At the same time, a higher citation count is shown especially by papers with a tag that is specifically scientifically oriented (""new finding""). The findings indicate that papers tailored for a readership outside the area of research should lead to societal impact.If altmetric data is to be used for the measurement of societal impact, the question arises of its normalization. In bibliometrics, citations are normalized for the papers' subject area and publication year. This study has taken a second analytic step involving a possible normalization of altmetric data. As the results show there are particular scientific topics which are of especial interest for a wide audience. Since these more or less interesting topics are not completely reflected in Thomson Reuters' journal sets, a normalization of altmetric data should not be based on the level of subject categories, but on the level of topics.

Our analysis is based on the references cited in the Higgs boson publications published since 1974. The objective of our analysis consists of identifying specific individual publications in the Higgs boson research context to which the scientific community frequently had referred to. We are interested in seminal works which contributed to a high extent to the discovery of the Higgs boson. Our results show that researchers in the Higgs boson field preferably refer to more recently published papers â€”particularly papers published since the beginning of the sixties. For example, our analysis reveals seven major contributions which appeared within the sixties: Englert and Brout (1964), Higgs (1964, 2 papers), and Guralnik et al. (1964) on the Higgs mechanism as well as Glashow (1961), Weinberg (1967), and Salam (1968) on the unification of weak and electromagnetic interaction. Even if the Nobel Prize award highlights the outstanding importance of the work of Peter Higgs and Francois Englert, bibliometrics offer the additional possibility of getting hints to other publications in this research field (especially to historical publications), which are of vital importance from the expert point of view.

The differing citation culture (in particular the different average number of references per paper and thereby the different probability of being cited) is widely seen as the cause of this variation. Based on all Web of Science (WoS) records published in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010 we demonstrate that almost all disciplines show similar numbers of references in the appendices of their papers. Our results suggest that the average citation rate is far more influenced by the extent to which the papers (cited as references) are included in WoS as linked database records. For example, the comparatively low citation rates in the humanities are not at all the result of a lower average number of references per paper but are caused by the low fraction of linked references which refer to papers published in the core journals covered by WoS.

Did this historical event affect international collaboration by researchers from the Eastern European countries with those of Western countries? Did it also change international collaboration among researchers from the Eastern European countries? Trying to answer these questions, this study aims to shed light on international collaboration by researchers from the Eastern European countries (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia). The number of publications and normalized citation impact values are compared for these countries based on InCites (Thomson Reuters), from 1981 up to 2011. The international collaboration by researchers affiliated to institutions in Eastern European countries at the time points of 1990, 2000 and 2011 was studied with the help of Pajek and VOSviewer software, based on data from the Science Citation Index (Thomson Reuters). Our results show that the breakdown of the communist regime did not lead, on average, to a huge improvement in the publication performance of the Eastern European countries and that the increase in international co-authorship relations by the researchers affiliated to institutions in these countries was smaller than expected. Most of the Eastern European countries are still subject to changes and are still awaiting their boost in scientific development.

With this method one can determine the historical roots of research fields and quantify their impact on current research. RPYS is based on the analysis of the frequency with which references are cited in the publications of a specific research field in terms of the publication years of these cited references. In this study, we illustrate that RPYS can also be used to reveal the origin of scientific legends. We selected ""Darwin finches"" as an example for illustration. Charles Darwin, the originator of evolutionary theory, was given credit for finches he did not see and for observations and insights about the finches he never made. We have shown that a book published in 1947 is the most-highly cited early reference cited within the relevant literature. This book had already been revealed as the origin of the term ""Darwin finches"" by Sulloway through careful historical analysis.

Research evaluation has been extended to include measures of the (1) social, (2) cultural, (3) environmental and (4) economic returns from publicly funded research. Even though no robust or reliable methods for measuring societal impact have yet been developed. In this study, we would like to introduce an approach which, unlike the currently common case study approach (and others), is relatively simple, can be used in almost every subject area and delivers results regarding societal impact which can be compared between disciplines. Our approach to societal impact starts with the actual function of science in society: to generate reliable knowledge. That is why a study (which we would like to refer to as an assessment report) summarising the status of the research on a certain subject represents knowledge which is available for society to access. Societal impact is given when the content of a report is addressed outside of science (in a government document, for example).

The application to information metrics (our own field of research) provides us with the opportunity to validate this methodology, and to add a reflection about using citations for the historical reconstruction. The results show that the field is rooted in individual contributions of the 1920s to 1950s (e.g., Alfred J. Lotka), and was then shaped intellectually in the early 1960s by a confluence of the history of science (Derek de Solla Price), documentation (e.g., Michael M. Kessler's ""bibliographic coupling""), and ""citation indexing"" (Eugene Garfield). Institutional development at the interfaces between science studies and information science has been reinforced by the new journal Informetrics since 2007. In a concluding reflection, we return to the question of how the historiography of science using algorithmic means-in terms of citation practices-can be different from an intellectual history of the field based, for example, on reading source materials.

Comparing the EU28, USA, and China at the global level shows a top-level dynamic that is different from the analysis in terms of shares of publications: the United States remains far more productive in the top-1% of all papers; China drops out of the competition for elite status; and the EU28 increased its share among the top-cited papers from 2000 to 2010. Some of the EU28 member states overtook the United States during this decade; but a clear divide remains between EU15 (Western Europe) and the Accession Countries.

With this method one can determine the historical roots of research fields and quantify their impact on current research. RPYS is based on the analysis of the frequency with which references are cited in the publications of a specific research field in terms of the publication years of these cited references.

In this study, we use research on graphene and on solar cells to illustrate how RPYS functions, and what results it can deliver.

The web application visualizes institutional performance within specific subject areas as ranking lists and on custom tile-based maps. The new, substantially enhanced version of the web application and the generalized linear mixed model for binomial data on which it is based are described in this paper. Scopus data are used which have been collected for the SCImago Institutions Ranking. Only those universities and research-focused institutions are considered that have published at least 500 articles, reviews and conference papers in the period 2006-2010 in a certain Scopus subject area. In the enhanced version, the effect of single covariates (such as the per capita GDP of a country in which an institution is located) on two performance metrics (best paper rate and best journal rate) is examined and visualized. A covariate-adjusted ranking and mapping of the institutions is produced in which the single covariates are held constant. The results on the performance of institutions can then be interpreted as if the institutions all had the same value (reference point) for the covariate in question. For example, those institutions can be identified worldwide showing a very good performance despite a bad financial situation in the corresponding country.

This paper further explores the possibility of improving citation impact measurements on the base of a short citation window by the consideration of journal impact and other variables, such as the number of authors, the number of cited references, and the number of pages. The dataset contains 475,391 journal papers published in 1980 and indexed in Web of Science (WoS, Thomson Reuters), and all annual citation counts (from 1980 to 2010) for these papers. As an indicator of citation impact, we used percentiles of citations calculated using the approach of Hazen (1914). Our results show that citation impact measurement can really be improved: If factors generally influencing citation impact are considered in the statistical analysis, the explained variance in the long-term citation impact can be much increased. However, this increase is only visible when using the years shortly after publication but not when using later years.

However, many different methods have been used in these studies to identify excellent papers. The present quantitative analysis of the literature has been carried out to acquire an overview of these methods and an indication of an 'average' or 'most frequent' bibliometric practice. The search in the Web of Science yielded 321 papers dealing with 'highly cited', 'most cited', 'top cited', and 'most frequently cited'. Of the 321 papers, 16 could not be used in this study. In around 80% of the papers analyzed in this study, a quantitative definition has been provided to identify excellent papers. With definitions that relate to an absolute number, either a certain number of top cited papers (58%) or papers with a minimum number of citations are selected (17%). Approximately 23% worked with percentile rank classes. Over these papers, there is an arithmetic average of the top 7.6% (arithmetic average) or of the top 3% (median). The top 1% is used most frequently in the papers, followed by the top 10%. With the thresholds presented in this study, in future, it will be possible to identify excellent papers based on an 'average' or 'most frequent' practice among bibliometricians.Â© The Author 2014.

If there is more than one subject category for a publication, it is initially unclear which category is to be used to create the reference set for the calculation of the percentile. This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: In this study the author would like to look at whether the calculation of differences between the citation impact of research institutions is affected by whether the minimum (the maximum percentile), the maximum (the minimum percentile), the mean or the median impact (percentile) for the different subject categories is used. The study is based on a sample of percentile data for three research institutions (n=4,232). Findings: The result of the comparison of citation impact of the three institutions remains very similar for all the calculation methods, but on a different level. Originality/value: It is the first study, which investigates how far it makes a difference in the comparison of the citation impact of three different research institutes whether - with multiple assignments of subject categories to one publication - the minimum, the maximum, the mean or the median inverted percentile is used. An answer to the question is very relevant since different methods are used in practical application. For example, the web-based research evaluation tool InCites uses the minimum percentile.

Only specific aspects of institutional performance are taken into account and other aspects such as teaching performance or societal impact of research are not considered. The purpose of this paper is to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Based on data gathered from Scopus, field-specific excellence can be identified in institutions where highly-cited papers have been frequently published. Findings - The web application (www.excellencemapping.net) combines both a list of institutions ordered by different indicator values and a map with circles visualising indicator values for geocoded institutions. Originality/value - Compared to the mapping and ranking approaches introduced hitherto, our underlying statistics (multi-level models) are analytically oriented by allowing the estimation of values for the number of excellent papers for an institution which are statistically more appropriate than the observed values; the calculation of confidence intervals as measures of accuracy for the institutional citation impact; the comparison of a single institution with an ""average"" institution in a subject area: and the direct comparison of at least two institutions.

Therefore, this study aims to set up proposals how to evaluate individual researchers working in the natural and life sciences. 2005 saw the introduction of the h index, which gives information about a researcher's productivity and the impact of his or her publications in a single number (h is the number of publications with at least h citations); however, it is not possible to cover the multidimensional complexity of research performance and to undertake inter-personal comparisons with this number. This study therefore includes recommendations for a set of indicators to be used for evaluating researchers. Our proposals relate to the selection of data on which an evaluation is based, the analysis of the data and the presentation of the results.

The SCOPUS database was used to retrieve records related to the nanotribology research for the period 1996-2010. Publications were counted on a fractional basis. The level of collaboration and its citation impact were examined. The performance of the most productive countries, institutes and most preferred journals is assessed. Various visualization tools such as the Sci2 tool and Ucinet were employed. The USA ranked top in terms of number of publications, citations per paper and h-index, while Switzerland published a higher percentage of international collaborative papers. The most productive institution was Tsinghua University followed by Ohio State University and Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, CAS. The most preferred journals were Tribology Letters, Wear and Journal of Japanese Society of Tribologists. The result of author keywords analysis reveals that Molecular Dynamics, MEMS, Hard Disk and Diamond like Carbon are major research topics.

However, it is rather difficult to identify historical roots in a systematic manner and to the best knowledge of the authors there is no method available which can be used independently of the research field. In this paper we introduce a new quantitative method to determine the historical roots of research fields and to quantify their impact on current research. Our method is based on the frequency of citations within a specific research field as a function of the publication year. Major historical contributions appear as more or less pronounced peaks, depending on the total number of citations within this research field. In most cases, these peaks are caused by high citation rates of individual historical publications. In analogy to spectroscopy which shows physical phenomena as peaks in a spectrum we have named our new method reference publication year spectroscopy (RPYS). In this study, we use research on graphene (a recently prepared new material) to illustrate how RPYS functions and what results it can deliver.

Even though this categorization does not relate directly to scientific performance, our results show that it exercises an important influence on the outcome of a performance measurement: Certain subject area types of institutions have an advantage in the ranking positions when compared with others.

This new distribution is then compared with previous output distributions by country but which were based on whole or fractional counting, not only for the total output but also for the excellence output (papers belonging to the 10 % most cited papers). The comparison allows one to examine the effect of the different methodological approaches on the scientific performance indicators assigned to countries. In some cases, there was a very large variation in scientific performance between the total output (whole counting) and output as research guarantor. The research guarantor approach is especially interesting when used with the excellence output where the quantity of excellent papers is also a quality indicator.

Percentile-based approaches have been proposed as a non-parametric alternative to parametric central-tendency statistics. Percentiles are based on an ordered set of citation counts in a reference set, whereby the fraction of papers at or below the citation counts of a focal paper is used as an indicator for its relative citation impact in the set. In this study, we pursue two related objectives: (1) although different percentile-based approaches have been developed, an approach is hitherto missing that satisfies a number of criteria such as scaling of the percentile ranks from zero (all other papers perform better) to 100 (all other papers perform worse), and solving the problem with tied citation ranks unambiguously. We introduce a new citation-rank approach having these properties, namely P100; (2) we compare the reliability of P100 empirically with other percentile-based approaches, such as the approaches developed by the SCImago group, the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), and Thomson Reuters (InCites), using all papers published in 1980 in Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WoS). How accurately can the different approaches predict the long-term citation impact in 2010 (in year 31) using citation impact measured in previous time windows (years 1-30)? The comparison of the approaches shows that the method used by InCites overestimates citation impact (because of using the highest percentile rank when papers are assigned to more than a single subject category) whereas the SCImago indicator shows higher power in predicting the long-term citation impact on the basis of citation rates in early years. Since the results show a disadvantage in this predictive ability for P100 against the other approaches, there is still room for further improvements.

The Leiden Ranking 2011/2012 (LR) was published early in 2012. Starting from Goldstein and Spiegelhalter's (1996) recommendations for conducting quantitative comparisons among institutions, in this study we undertook a reformulation of the LR by means of multilevel regression models. First, with our models we replicated the ranking results; second, the reanalysis of the LR data showed that only 5% of the PPtop10% total variation is attributable to differences between universities. Beyond that, about 80% of the variation between universities can be explained by differences among countries. If covariates are included in the model the differences among most of the universities become meaningless. Our findings have implications for conducting university rankings in general and for the LR in particular. For example, with Goldstein-adjusted confidence intervals, it is possible to interpret the significance of differences among universities meaningfully: Rank differences among universities should be interpreted as meaningful only if their confidence intervals do not overlap.

An evaluation report without bibliometric data has become a rarity. However, evaluations are often required to measure the citation impact of publications in very recent years in particular. As a citation analysis is only meaningful for publications for which a citation window of at least three years is guaranteed, very recent years cannot (should not) be included in the analysis. This study presents various options for dealing with this problem in statistical analysis. The publications from two universities from 2000 to 2011 are used as a sample dataset (n= 2652, univ 1= 1484 and univ 2= 1168). One option is to show the citation impact data (percentiles) in a graphic and to use a line for percentiles regressed on 'distant' publication years (with confidence interval) showing the trend for the 'very recent' publication years. Another way of dealing with the problem is to work with the concept of samples and populations. The third option (very related to the second) is the application of the counterfactual concept of causality.

Based on a secondary analysis of data from final project reports (ex post research evaluation) at the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), Austria's central funding organization for basic research, the goals are (1) to find, across all scientific disciplines, types of funded research projects with similar research output profiles; and (2) to classify the scientific disciplines in homogeneous segments bottom-up according to the frequency distribution of these research output profiles. The data comprised 1,742 completed, FWF-funded research projects across 22 scientific disciplines. The multilevel latent class (LC) analysis produced four LCs or types of research output profiles: 'Not Book', 'Book and Non-Reviewed Journal Article', 'Multiple Outputs', and 'Journal Article, Conference Contribution, and Career Development'. The class membership can be predicted by three covariates: project duration, requested grant sum, and project head's age. In addition, five segments of disciplines can be distinguished: 'Life Sciences and Medicine', 'Social Sciences/Arts and Humanities', 'Formal Sciences', 'Technical Sciences', and 'Physical Sciences'. In 'Social Sciences/Arts and Humanities' almost all projects are of the type 'Book and Non-Reviewed Journal Article', but, vice versa, not all projects of the 'Book and Non-reviewed Journal Article' type are in the 'Social Sciences/Arts and Humanities' segment. The research projects differ not only qualitatively in their output profile; they also differ quantitatively, so that projects can be ranked according to amount of output.

The standards relate to the selection of data on which an evaluation is based, the analysis of the data and the presentation of the results.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors define fallout rate and missing rate in order to describe quantitatively the weak papers that were accepted and the strong papers that were missed, respectively. To assess the quality of manuscripts the authors use bibliometric measures. Findings: Fallout rate and missing rate are put in relation with the hitting rate and success rate. Conclusions are drawn on what fraction of weak papers will be accepted in order to have a certain fraction of strong accepted papers. Originality/value: The paper illustrates that these curves are new in peer review research when interpreted in the information retrieval terminology.

According to Williams (2012) an empirical study should be concerned with the substantive and practical significance of the findings as well as the sign and statistical significance of effects. In this study we will explain what adjusted predictions and marginal effects are and how useful they are for institutional evaluative bibliometrics. As an illustration, we will calculate a regression model using publications (and citation data) produced by four universities in German-speaking countries from 1980 to 2010. We will show how these predictions and effects can be estimated and plotted, and how this makes it far easier to get a practical feel for the substantive meaning of results in evaluative bibliometric studies. An added benefit of this approach is that it makes it far easier to explain results obtained via sophisticated statistical techniques to a broader and sometimes non-technical audience. We will focus particularly on Average Adjusted Predictions (AAPs), Average Marginal Effects (AMEs), Adjusted Predictions at Representative Values (APRVs) and Marginal Effects at Representative Values (MERVs).

F1000 is a post-publication peer review system of the biomedical literature. The comparison of metrics with peer evaluation has been widely acknowledged as a way of validating metrics. Based on the seven indicators offered by InCites, we analyzed the validity of raw citation counts (Times Cited, 2nd Generation Citations, and 2nd Generation Citations per Citing Document), normalized indicators (Journal Actual/Expected Citations, Category Actual/Expected Citations, and Percentile in Subject Area), and a journal based indicator (Journal Impact Factor). The data set consists of 125 papers published in 2008 and belonging to the subject category cell biology or immunology. As the results show, Percentile in Subject Area achieves the highest correlation with F1000 ratings; we can assert that for further three other indicators (Times Cited, 2nd Generation Citations, and Category Actual/Expected Citations) the ""true"" correlation with the ratings reaches at least a medium effect size.

This study suggests how percentiles (and percentile rank classes) can be analyzed meaningfully for an evaluation study. Publication sets from four universities are compared with each other to provide sample data. These suggestions take into account on the one hand the distribution of percentiles over the publications in the sets (universities here) and on the other hand concentrate on the range of publications with the highest citation impact - that is, the range that is usually of most interest in the evaluation of scientific performance.

InCites offers a unique opportunity to study the normalized citation impacts of countries using (i) a long publication window (1981 to 2010), (ii) a differentiation in (broad or more narrow) subject areas, and (iii) allowing for the use of statistical procedures in order to obtain an insightful investigation of national citation trends across the years. Using four broad categories, our results show significantly increasing trends in citation impact values for France, the UK, and especially Germany across the last thirty years in all areas. The citation impact of papers from China is still at a relatively low level (mostly below the world average), but the country follows an increasing trend line. The USA exhibits a stable pattern of high citation impact values across the years. With small impact differences between the publication years, the US trend is increasing in engineering and technology but decreasing in medical and health sciences as well as in agricultural sciences. Similar to the USA, Japan follows increasing as well as decreasing trends in different subject areas, but the variability across the years is small. In most of the years, papers from Japan perform below or approximately at the world average in each subject area.

Society can reap the benefits of successful research studies only if the results are converted into marketable and consumable products (e.g., medicaments, diagnostic tools, machines, and devices) or services. A series of different names have been introduced which refer to the societal impact of research: third stream activities, societal benefits, societal quality, usefulness, public values, knowledge transfer, and societal relevance. What most of these names are concerned with is the assessment of social, cultural, environmental, and economic returns (impact and effects) from results (research output) or products (research outcome) of publicly funded research. This review intends to present existing research on and practices employed in the assessment of societal impact in the form of a literature survey. The objective is for this review to serve as a basis for the development of robust and reliable methods of societal impact measurement.

According to philosopher of science Thomas S. Kuhn, scientific advancement takes place via paradigm shift. As a principle supplementing Kuhn's theory, we proposed the Anna Karenina principle: a new paradigm can be successful only when several key prerequisites are fulfilled (e. g., verified by means of independent data and methods). If any one of these prerequisites is not fulfilled, the paradigm will not be successful. Aiming at investigating the schema of paradigm shift supplemented by the Anna Karenina principle with the aid of concrete examples from science, in this study we analyze one of the most important scientific revolutions: the shift from a fixed to a mobile worldview in geoscientific thinking. This paradigm shift will be explained based on key papers that played a decisive role, selected carefully from reviews in the literature. The account of the development will be complemented by empirical findings that were produced based on publication and citation data using the software Histcite.

The times cited approach counts the citations of a given publication set. In contrast, we change the perspective and start by selecting all papers dealing with a specific research topic or field (the example in this study is research on Aspirin). Then we extract all cited references from the papers of this field-specific publication set and analyse which papers, scientists, and journals have been cited most often. In this study, we use the Chemical Abstracts registry number to select the publications for a specific field. However, the cited reference approach can be used with any other field classification system proposed up to now.

Do these approaches lead to field-normalized impact measures for journals? In addition to the 2-year IF (IF2), we consider the 5-year IF (IF5), the respective numerators of these IFs, and the number of Total Cites, counted both as integers and fractionally. These various indicators are tested against the hypothesis that the classification of journals into 11 broad fields by PatentBoard/NSF (National Science Foundation) provides statistically significant between-field effects. Using fractional counting the between-field variance is reduced by 91.7% in the case of IF5, and by 79.2% in the case of IF2. However, the differences in citation counts are not significantly affected by fractional counting. These results accord with previous studies, but the longer citation window of a fractionally counted IF5 can lead to significant improvement in the normalization across fields.

Data refer to all psychology articles published in 2007 which are documented in the Social Science Citation Index and to their citation frequencies from 2007 to May 2011. 218 cities are visualized with an article output of at least 50 in 2007. Statistical z tests are used for the evaluation of the degree to which an observed number of top-cited papers (top-10%) for a city differs from the number expected on the basis of randomness in the selection of papers. The map points at excellence centers in cities at the East and West Coast of the USA as well as in Great Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Finland, Australia, and Taiwan. These results indicate that highly-cited psychological research articles come from the Anglo-American countries and some of the non-English European countries in which the number of English-language publications has increased during the last decades. Implications of the results for the publication strategies of psychologists in non-English speaking countries are discussed as well as the neccessity to care for qualitative criteria in evaluations in addition to quantitative, scientometric criteria.","Bibliometrics; Citation analysis; Psychology; Research excellence; Scientometrics","Abramo, G., D'Angelo, C.A., Evaluating research: From informed peer review to bibliometrics (2011) Scientometrics, 87 (3), pp. 499-514. , doi:10.1007/s11192-011-0352-7; Arnett, J.J., The neglected 95%: Why American psychology needs to become less American (2008) The American Psychologist, 63 (7), pp. 602-614. , doi:10.1037/0003-066X.63.7.602; Arnett, J.J., The neglected 95%, a challenge to psychology's philosophy of science (2009) The American Psychologist, 64 (6), pp. 571-574. , doi:10.1037/a0016723; Berry, J.W., Poortinga, Y.H., Segall, M.H., Dasen, P.R., (2002) Cross-cultural psychology: Research and applications, , (2nd ed.).

The numerous dos and don'ts that exist in the field represent the implicit knowledge of experienced users, rather than a clearly defined set of rules and operating procedures. Our chapter seeks to establish standards for applying bibliometrics to the evaluation of research institutes in a number of areas in the natural sciences. These standards refer to the selection of the underlying data from the reference databases, the statistical analysis of the data and the presentation of results. We draw upon anonymized data from six research institutes active in similar research areas to illustrate the applicability of our proposed standards.","Bibliometrics; Citations; Publication Output; Standards","Abbott, A., Cyranoski, D., Jones, N., Maher, B., Schiermeier, Q., van Noorden, R., Metrics: Do Metrics Matter?

These indexes follow the general principle of repeating the index calculation for the same publication set. Using bibliometric data and reviewer scores for accepted and rejected fellowship applicants we examine how valid the cumulative variant is compared to the original variant. These analyses showed that the cumulative indexes result in higher correlations with the reviewer scores than their original variants. Thus, the cumulative indexes better reflect the assessments by peers than the original variants and are useful extensions of the original indexes. In contrast to many other measures of scientific performance proposed up to now, the cumulative indexes seem not only to be effective, but they are also easy to understand and calculate.

Studies on the inter-rater reliability of peer reviews mostly report only average values across all submitted proposals. But inter-rater reliabilities can vary depending on the scientific discipline or the requested grant sum, for instance. Goal: Taking the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) as an example, we aimed to investigate empirically the heterogeneity of inter-rater reliabilities (intraclass correlation) and its determinants. Methods: The data consisted of N = 8,329 proposals with N = 23,414 overall ratings by reviewers, which were statistically analyzed using the generalized estimating equations approach (GEE). Results: We found an overall intraclass correlation (ICC) of reviewer? ratings of Ï� =. 259 with a 95% confidence interval of [.249,.279]. In humanities the ICCs were statistically significantly higher than in all other research areas except technical sciences. The ICC in biosciences deviated statistically significantly from the average ICC. Other factors (besides the research areas), such as the grant sum requested, had negligible influence on the ICC. Conclusions: Especially in biosciences, the number of reviewers of each proposal should be increased so as to increase the ICC.

Here, Tolstoy means that for a family to be happy, several key aspects must be given (e.g., good health of all family members, acceptable financial security, and mutual affection). If there is a deficiency in any one or more of these key aspects, the family will be unhappy. In this article, we introduce the Anna Karenina principle as a way of thinking about success in science in three central areas in (modern) science: (a) peer review of research grant proposals and manuscripts (money and journal space as scarce resources), (b) citation of publications (reception as a scarce resource), and (c) new scientific discoveries (recognition as a scarce resource). If resources are scarce at the highly competitive research front (journal space, funds, reception, and recognition), there can be success only when several key prerequisites for the allocation of the resources are fulfilled. If any one of these prerequisites is not fulfilled, the grant proposal, manuscript submission, the published paper, or the discovery will not be successful.

In this study we evaluated the grant peer review process (external reviewers' ratings, and board of trustees' final decision: approval or no approval for funding) at the Austrian Science Fund with respect to gender. The data consisted of 8,496 research proposals (census) across all disciplines from 1999 to 2009, which were rated on a scale from 1 to 100 (poor to excellent) by 18,357 external reviewers in 23,977 reviews. In line with the current state of research, we found that the final decision was not associated with applicant's gender or with any correspondence between gender of applicants and reviewers. However, the decisions on the grant applications showed a robust female reviewer salience effect. The approval probability decreases (up to 10%), when there is parity or a majority of women in the group of reviewers. Our results confirm an overall gender null hypothesis for the peer review process of men's and women's grant applications in contrast to claims that women's grants are systematically downrated.

Due to different human perceptions, the evaluation of papers by peer review (for a journal) can be different from the impact that a paper has after its publication (measured by number of citations received) in this or another journal. This system (and corresponding problems) is similar to the information retrieval process in a documentary system. Also there, one retrieves not always the most relevant documents for a certain topic. This is so because the topic is described in the command language of the documentary system and this command does not always completely cover the ""real topic"" that one wants to describe. This paper aims to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach: Based on this statement classical information retrieval evaluation techniques were applied to the evaluation of peer review systems. Basic in such an information retrieval evaluation are the notions of precision and recall and the precision-recall-curve. Such notions are introduced here for the evaluation of peer review systems. Findings: The analogues of precision and recall are defined and their curve constructed based on peer review data from the journal Angewandte Chemie - International Edition and on citation impact data of accepted papers by this journal or rejected but published elsewhere papers. It is concluded that, due to the imperfect peer review process (based on human evaluation), if we want to publish a high amount of qualified papers (the ones we seek), several non-qualified papers should also be accepted. Originality/value: The authors conclude that, due to the imperfect peer review process (based on human evaluation), if we want to publish a high amount of qualified papers (the ones we seek), one will also accept several non-qualified papers.

The overlays indicate both the quantity and the quality of patents at the city level. This information is relevant for research questions in technology analysis, innovation studies, and evolutionary economics, as well as economic geography. The resulting maps can also be relevant for technological innovation policies and research and development management, because the U.S. market can be considered the leading market for patenting and patent competition. In addition to the maps, the routines provide quantitative data about the patents for statistical analysis. The cities on the map are colored according to the results of significance tests. The overlays are explored for the Netherlands as a ""national system of innovations"" and further elaborated in two cases of emerging technologies: ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) and nanotechnology.

Design/methodology/approach-discusses the quality evaluation of refereed scholarly journals. Findings-a key finding of this research was that in the peer review process of one and the same manuscript, reviewers or editors, respectively, arrive at different judgments. This phenomenon is named as ""Hawthorne effect"" because the different judgements are dependent on the specific conditions under which the peer review process at the individual journals takes place.

In this study, using the data of two comprehensive evaluation studies on the CPR process at Angewandte Chemie-International Edition and the PPR process at Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, we examined the language characteristics in comments that were written by invited reviewers in CPR and by invited reviewers and interested members of the scientific community in PPR. We used Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a text analysis software program that counts words in meaningful categories (e. g., positive or negative emotions) using a standardized dictionary. We examined 599 comments from the reviews of 229 manuscripts. The results show that the comments in PPR are much longer than the comments in CPR. This is an indication that PPR reviewing has more of an improvement function and CPR reviewing has more of a selection function. The results also show that CPR is not, as might be expected, more susceptible to the expression of negative emotions than PPR is.

Available to us for this investigation are 390 reviewer comments and short comments assessing 119 manuscripts submitted to the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP). We conducted a content analysis of these comments to determine differences in the main thematic areas considered by the scientists in their assessment comments. The results of the analysis show that in contrast to interested members of the scientific community, reviewers focus mainly on (1) the formal qualities of a manuscript, such as writing style, (2) the conclusions drawn in a manuscript, and (3) the future ""gain"" that could result from publication of a manuscript. All in all, it appears that 'reviewer comments' better than 'short comments' by interested members of the scientific community support the two main functions of peer review: selection and improvement of what is published.

In this paper our aim is to investigate these factors that usually impact the number of citation counts, using an extensive data set from the field of chemistry. The data set contains roughly 2000 manuscripts that were submitted to the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition (AC-IE) as short communications, reviewed by external reviewers, and either published in AC-IE or, if not accepted for publication by AC-IE, published elsewhere. As the reviewers' ratings of the importance of the manuscripts' results are also available to us, we can examine the extent to which certain factors that previous studies demonstrated to be generally correlated with citation counts increase the impact of papers, controlling for the quality of the manuscripts (as measured by reviewers' ratings of the importance of the findings) in the statistical analysis. As the results show, besides being associated with quality, citation counts are correlated with the citation performance of the cited references, the language of the publishing journal, the chemical subfield, and the reputation of the authors. In this study no statistically significant correlation was found between citation counts and number of authors.

To demonstrate that this single publication h index is a useful yardstick to compare the quality of different publications; the index should be strongly related to the assessment by peers. In a comprehensive research project we investigated the peer review process of the Angewandte Chemie International Edition. The data set contains manuscripts reviewed in the year 2000 and accepted by the journal or rejected but published elsewhere. Single publication h index values were calculated for a total of 1,814 manuscripts. The results show a correlation in the expected direction between peer assessments and single publication h index values: After publication, manuscripts with positive ratings by the journal's reviewers show on average higher h index values than manuscripts with negative ratings by reviewers (and later published elsewhere). However, our findings do not support Schubert's (2009) assumption that the additional dimension of indirect citation influence contributes to a more refined picture of the most cited papers.

Impacts add up, and citation curves therefore should be integrated instead of averaged. For example, the journals MIS Quarterly and Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology differ by a factor of 2 in terms of their respective impact factors (IF), but the journal with the lower IF has the higher impact. Using percentile ranks (e.g., top-1%, top-10%, etc.), an Integrated Impact Indicator (I3) can be based on integration of the citation curves, but after normalization of the citation curves to the same scale. The results across document sets can be compared as percentages of the total impact of a reference set. Total number of citations, however, should not be used instead because the shape of the citation curves is then not appreciated. I3 can be applied to any document set and any citation window. The results of the integration (summation) are fully decomposable in terms of journals or institutional units such as nations, universities, and so on because percentile ranks are determined at the paper level. In this study, we first compare I3 with IFs for the journals in two Institute for Scientific Information subject categories (""Information Science & Library Science"" and ""Multidisciplinary Sciences""). The library and information science set is additionally decomposed in terms of nations. Policy implications of this possible paradigm shift in citation impact analysis are specified.

Is the best scientific work selected from submitted manuscripts? Does selection of the best manuscripts also mean selecting papers that after publication show top citation performance within their fields? Taking the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition as an example, this study proposes a new methodology for investigating whether manuscripts that are most worthy of publication are in fact selected validly. First, the influence on citation of the accepted and rejected but then published elsewhere manuscripts was appraised on the basis of percentile impact classes scaled in a subfield of chemistry and, second, the association between the decisions on selection and the influence on citation of the manuscripts was determined by using a multilevel logistic regression for ordinal categories.

A high correlation between the h index and its variants would indicate that the h index variants hardly provide added information to the h index. This meta-analysis included 135 correlation coefficients from 32 studies. The studies were based on a total sample size of N= 9005; on average, each study had a sample size of n= 257. The results of a three-level cross-classified mixed-effects meta-analysis show a high correlation between the h index and its variants: Depending on the model, the mean correlation coefficient varies between .8 and .9. This means that there is redundancy between most of the h index variants and the h index. There is a statistically significant study-to-study variation of the correlation coefficients in the information they yield. The lowest correlation coefficients with the h index are found for the h index variants MII and m index. Hence, these h index variants make a non-redundant contribution to the h index.

Citation distributions are-as a rule-highly skewed and should not be arithmetically averaged. With percentile ranks, the citation score of each paper is rated in terms of its percentile in the citation distribution. The percentile ranks approach allows for the formulation of a more abstract indicator scheme that can be used to organize and/or schematize different impact indicators according to three degrees of freedom: the selection of the reference sets, the evaluation criteria, and the choice of whether or not to define the publication sets as independent. Bibliometric data of seven principal investigators (PIs) of the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam are used as an exemplary dataset. We demonstrate that the proposed family indicators [R(6), R(100), R(6, k), R(100, k)] are an improvement on averages-based indicators because one can account for the shape of the distributions of citations over papers.

This paper aims to look at the calculation of the single publication h index and related performance measures. Design/methodology/ approach - In this paper a web application is presented where the single publication h index and related performance measures (the single publication m index, h 2 lower, h 2 centre, and h 2 upper) can be automatically calculated for any publication indexed by Google Scholar. Findings - The use of the application is demonstrated by means of the citation performance of two publications. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge this web application is the first instrument to automatically calculate the single publication h index and related performance measures based on Google Scholar data. This is a new service especially from the perspective of the related performance measures.

Can these drawbacks be counteracted by fractionally counting citation weights instead of using whole numbers in the numerators? (a) Fractional citation counts are normalized in terms of the citing sources and thus would take into account differences in citation behavior among fields of science. (b) Differences in the resulting distributions can be tested statistically for their significance at different levels of aggregation. (c) Fractional counting can be generalized to any document set including journals or groups of journals, and thus the significance of differences among both small and large sets can be tested. A list of fractionally counted IFs for 2008 is available online at The between-group variance among the 13 fields of science identified in the U.S. Science and Engineering Indicators is no longer statistically significant after this normalization. Although citation behavior differs largely between disciplines, the reflection of these differences in fractionally counted citation distributions can not be used as a reliable instrument for the classification.

ACP is a high-impact journal publishing papers on the Earth's atmosphere and the underlying chemical and physical processes. Scientific journals have to deal with the following question concerning the predictive validity: Are in fact the ""best"" scientific works selected from the manuscripts submitted? In this study we examined whether selecting the ""best"" manuscripts means selecting papers that after publication show top citation performance as compared to other papers in this research area. First, we appraised the citation impact of later published manuscripts based on the percentile citedness rank classes of the population distribution (scaling in a specific subfield). Second, we analyzed the association between the decisions (n = 677 accepted or rejected, but published elsewhere manuscripts) or ratings (reviewers' ratings for n = 315 manuscripts), respectively, and the citation impact classes of the manuscripts. The results confirm the predictive validity of the ACP peer review system.

The index is based on the definition of a h-index for increasing sequences. We show that the index has several good properties in the sense that the shorter the times are between publication and first citation (in a global manner) the higher the FCSI is. We present two case studies: a first-citation speed comparison of three journals in the field of psychology and a first-citation speed comparison of accepted and rejected, but published elsewhere manuscripts by the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition.

IRR is defined as the extent to which two or more independent reviews of the same scientific document agree. Methodology/Principal Findings: Altogether, 70 reliability coefficients (Cohen's Kappa, intra-class correlation [ICC], and Pearson product-moment correlation [r]) from 48 studies were taken into account in the meta-analysis. The studies were based on a total of 19,443 manuscripts; on average, each study had a sample size of 311 manuscripts (minimum: 28, maximum: 1983). The results of the meta-analysis confirmed the findings of the narrative literature reviews published to date: The level of IRR (mean ICC/r2 =.34, mean Cohen's Kappa =.17) was low. To explain the study-to-study variation of the IRR coefficients, meta-regression analyses were calculated using seven covariates. Two covariates that emerged in the metaregression analyses as statistically significant to gain an approximate homogeneity of the intra-class correlations indicated that, firstly, the more manuscripts that a study is based on, the smaller the reported IRR coefficients are. Secondly, if the information of the rating system for reviewers was reported in a study, then this was associated with a smaller IRR coefficient than if the information was not conveyed. Conclusions/Significance: Studies that report a high level of IRR are to be considered less credible than those with a low level of IRR. According to our meta-analysis the IRR of peer assessments is quite limited and needs improvement (e.g., reader system). Â© 2010 Bornmann et al.",,"Ziman, J., (2000) Real science.

Methodology/Principal Findings: The Ortega hypothesis predicts that highly-cited papers and medium-cited (or lowly +cited) papers would equally refer to papers with a medium impact. The Newton hypothesis would be supported if the top level research more frequently cites previously highly-cited work than that medium-level research cites highly-cited work. Our analysis is based on (i) all articles and proceedings papers which were published in 2003 in the life sciences, health sciences, physical sciences, and social sciences, and (ii) all articles and proceeding papers which were cited within these publications. The results show that highly-cited work in all scientific fields more frequently cites previously highly-cited papers than that medium-cited work cites highly-cited work. Conclusions/Significance: We demonstrate that papers contributing to the scientific progress in a field lean to a larger extent on previously important contributions than papers contributing little. These findings support the Newton hypothesis and call into question the Ortega hypothesis (given our usage of citation counts as a proxy for impact).

The bias variable investigated here was the information on whether authors had suggested a possible reviewer for their manuscript, and whether the editor had taken up that suggestion or had chosen a reviewer that had not been suggested by the authors. Studies have shown that authorsuggested reviewers rate manuscripts more favorably than editor-suggested reviewers do. Methodology/Principal Findings: Reviewers' ratings on three evaluation criteria and the reviewers' final publication recommendations were available for 552 manuscripts (in total 1145 reviews) that were submitted to Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, an interactive open access journal using public peer review (authors' and reviewers' comments are publicly exchanged). Public peer review is supposed to bring a new openness to the reviewing process that will enhance its objectivity. In the statistical analysis the quality of a manuscript was controlled for to prevent favorable reviewers' ratings from being attributable to quality instead of to the bias variable. Conclusions/Significance: Our results agree with those from other studies that editor-suggested reviewers rated manuscripts between 30% and 42% less favorably than author-suggested reviewers. Against this backdrop journal editors should consider either doing without the use of author-suggested reviewers or, if they are used, bringing in more than one editor-suggested reviewer for the review process (so that the review by author-suggested reviewers can be put in perspective).

To make funding recommendations, the reviewers convene to evaluate the quality of grant applications. Many research studies in social psychology have investigated what (undesired) phenomena (such as groupthink, motivation losses, and group polarization) can occur in group judgment and decision-making. In the research on peer review, however, these phenomena have not been examined up to now. This article describes the peer review panel with the help of features used in social psychology to characterize groups (such as entitativity of groups, group task) and presents phenomena from the research in social psychology that can have an (undesired) effect on the judgment of panel groups. Measures to counteract these phenomena are discussed. The necessity of research in this area is pointed out.

For the development of time-specific reference standards, the authors determined (a) the mean citation rates of papers in selected physics journals as well as (b) the mean citation rates of all papers in physics published in 1900 (Little Science) and in 2000 (Big Science); this was accomplished by relying on the processes of field-specific standardization in bibliometry. For the sake of developing reference multipliers with which the citation impact of earlier papers can be adjusted to the citation impact of contemporary papers, they combined the reference standards calculated for 1900 and 2000 into their ratio. The use of reference multipliers is demonstrated by means of two examples involving the time adjusted h index values for Max Planck and Albert Einstein.

To assess usefulness, it is important to include in addition the base rate (proportion of submissions that are fundamentally suitable for publication) and the selection rate (the proportion of submissions accepted). Methodology/Principal Findings: Taking the example of the high-impact journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition (AC-IE), we present a general approach for determining the usefulness of peer reviews for the selection of manuscripts for publication. The results of our study show that peer review is useful: 78% of the submissions accepted by AC-IE are correctly accepted for publication when the editor's decision is based on one review, 69% of the submissions are correctly accepted for publication when the editor's decision is based on two reviews, and 65% of the submissions are correctly accepted for publication when the editor's decision is based on three reviews. Conclusions/Significance: The paper points out through what changes in the selection rate, base rate or validity coefficient a higher success rate (utility) in the AC-IE selection process could be achieved.

But it has been criticized for its insufficient accuracy-the ability to discriminate reliably between meaningful amounts of research output. As a single measure it cannot capture the complete information on the citation distribution over a scientist's publication list. An extensive data set with bibliometric data on scientists working in the field of molecular biology is taken as an example to introduce two approaches providing additional information to the h index: (1) h2 lower, h2 center, and h2 upper are proposed, which allow quantification of three areas within a scientist's citation distribution: the low impact area (h2 lower), the area captured by the h index (h2 center), and the area of publications with the highest visibility (h2 upper). (2) Given the existence of different areas in the citation distribution, the segmented regression model (sRM) is proposed as a method to statistically estimate the number of papers in a scientist's publication list with the highest visibility. However, such sRM values should be compared across individuals with great care.

The data sets involve 671 applications in social sciences and 668 applications in life sciences. In both fields, awarded applicants perform on average better than all rejected applicants. If only the most preeminent rejected applicants are considered in both fields, they score better than the awardees on citation impact. With regard to productivity we find differences between the fields.

But doubts exist about the quality of the manuscript selection process for publication in these journals. In this study we investigate the quality of the selection process of an OA journal, taking as an example the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP). ACP is working with a new system of public peer review. We examine the predictive validity of the ACP peer review system, namely, whether the process selects the best of the manuscripts submitted. We have data for 1,111 manuscripts that went through the complete ACP selection process in the years 2001 to 2006. The predictive validity was investigated on the basis of citation counts for the later published manuscripts. The results of the citation analysis confirm the predictive validity of the reviewers' ratings and the editorial decisions at ACP: Both covary with citation counts for the published manuscripts.

Further, it appears that external review is indispensable for the decision on the publication worthiness of manuscripts: (1) For the majority of submitted manuscripts, staff editors are uncertain about publication worthiness; (2) there is a statistically significant proportional difference in ""Rejection"" between the editors' initial evaluation and the final editorial decision (after peer review); (3) three-quarters of the manuscripts that were rated negatively at the initial internal evaluation but accepted for publication after the peer review had far above-average citation counts.

Thomas Kuhn argued against this view and claimed that science always follows this pattern: after a phase of ""normal"" science, a scientific ""revolution"" occurs. Taking as a case study the transition from the static view of the universe to the Big Bang theory in cosmology, we appraised Kuhn's theoretical approach by conducting a historical reconstruction and a citation analysis. As the results show, the transition in cosmology can be linked to many different persons, publications, and points in time. The findings indicate that there was not one (short term) scientific revolution in cosmology but instead a paradigm shift that progressed as a slow, piecemeal process.

Using as an example the peer review system of Angewandte Chemie International Edition (AC-IE), this study investigates which review requests are assigned by the editors to external reviewers, which sequences of review steps typically occur, and which rules are used by the editors to decide whether to accept or reject a manuscript for publication. For the investigation, information has been used on a total of 1899 manuscripts that were reviewed in the year 2000. The results show that in the majority of the manuscripts, the editors follow a so-called ""clear-cut"" rule: A manuscript is only accepted for publication if it has been positively assessed beforehand by two independent reviewers with regard to the importance of the results and the suitability of publication of the manuscript. For about a fifth of the manuscripts, the editors (a) consulted a top adviser for manuscript review, (b) asked a reviewer to review a manuscript revised by the author, or (c) asked a reviewer to read an appeal that an author filed against the rejection of his/her manuscript.

For this purpose, a content analysis was performed of comments which led to the rejection of the manuscripts at AC-IE. For the content analysis, a classification scheme with thematic areas developed by Bornmann et al. (2008) was used. As the results of the analysis demonstrate, a large number of negative comments from referees in the areas ""Relevance of contribution"" and ""Design/Conception"" are clear signs that a manuscript rejected at AC-IE will not be published later in a high-impact journal. The number of negative statements in the areas ""Writing/Presentation,"" ""Discussion of results,"" ""Method/Statistics,"" and ""Reference to the literature and documentation,"" on the other hand, had no statistically significant influence on the probability that a rejected manuscript would later be published in a low- or high-impact journal.

To analyze referees' recommendations, an ordinal regression model (ORM) with a total of 3,705 reviews by 1,542 referees on 1,744 manuscripts was used. To analyze the editors' decisions, a logistic regression model (LRM) with a total of 1,745 manuscripts was used. In addition to bias variables, an indicator (measured ex-post) for the scientific impact of a manuscript was taken into account. The results of the ORMs show that the number of institutions mentioned in the Acknowledgements of a manuscript, the share of authors having institutional affiliations in Germany, the institutional address of the referee (in Germany or not in Germany), and 'author suggested a referee for the manuscript' have statistically significant effects on the referees' recommendations. The LRM shows that the number of institutions that are mentioned in the Acknowledgements and the share of authors having institutional affiliations in Germany are potential sources of bias in the editors' decisions.

We evaluate gender differences in peer reviews of grant applications, extending Bornmann, Mutz, and Daniel's meta-analyses that reported small gender differences in favor of men (d =. 04), but a substantial heterogeneity in effect sizes that compromised the robustness of their results. We contrast these findings with the most comprehensive single primary study (Marsh, Jayasinghe, and Bond) that found no gender differences for grant proposals. We juxtapose traditional (fixed- and random-effects) and multilevel models, demonstrating important advantages to the multilevel approach. Consistent with Marsh et al.'s primary study, there were no gender differences for the 40 (of 66) effect sizes from Bornmannet al.that were based on grant proposals. This lack of a gender effect for grant proposals was very robust, generalizing over country, discipline, and publication year.

Bornmann et al (2008a, 2009b) tested (1) whether the variants developed are associated with an incremental contribution for evaluation purposes against the h index, (2) whether there is any need at all for the h index and its variants besides standard bibliometric measures and (3) which of the h index and its variants predict peer assessments of scientific performance at best. As all results of Bornmann et al (2008a, 2009b) are based on bibliometric data on post-doctoral research fellowship recipients of the Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds, it will be important to test whether the results can be validated using other data sets. Therefore, we examined in this study 693 applicants to the Long-Term Fellowship programme of the European Molecular Biology Organization whether the results found by Bornmann et al (2008a, 2009b) can be validated using another data set and further h index variants. All in all, with the findings in this study all results to the h index and its variants could be validated that are reported in Bornmann et al (2008a, 2009b).

To calculate Cf, the citation rate for a single paper is divided by the average number of citations for all papers in the discipline in which the single paper has been categorized. c2 values are said to lead to a universality of discipline-specific citation distributions. Using a comprehensive dataset of an evaluation study on Angewandte Chemie International Edition (AC-IE), we tested the advantage of using this indicator in practical application at the micro level, as compared with (1) simple citation rates, and (2) z-scores, which have been used in psychological testing for many years for normalization of test scores. To calculate zscores, the mean number of citations of the papers within a discipline is subtracted from the citation rate of a single paper, and the difference is then divided by the citations' standard deviation for a discipline. Our results indicate that z-scores are better suited than C f values to produce universality of discipline-specific citation distributions.

Results from our recent study (L. Bornmann, R. Mutz, & H.-D. Daniel, 2008) have indicated that there are two types of indices: One type of indices (e.g., h index) describes the most productive core of a scientist's output and informs about the number of papers in the core. The other type of indices (e.g., a index) depicts the impact of the papers in the core. In evaluative bibliometric studies, the two dimensions quantity and quality of output are usually assessed using the SBMs ""number of publications"" (for the quantity dimension) and ""total citation counts"" (for the impact dimension). We additionally included the SBMs into the factor analysis. The results of the newly calculated analysis indicate that there is a high intercorrelation between ""number of publications"" and the indices that load substantially on the factor Quantity of the Productive Core as well as between ""total citation counts"" and the indices that load substantially on the factor Impact of the Productive Core. The high-loading indices and SBMs within one performance dimension could be called redundant in empirical application, as high intercorrelations between different indicators are a sign for measuring something similar (or the same). Based on our findings, we propose the use of any pair of indicators (one relating to the number of papers in a researcher's productive core and one relating to the impact of these core papers) as a meaningful approach for comparing scientists.

His index is an original and simple new measure that incorporates both quantity and visibility of publications. Since 2005, a number of corrections and complementary indices to the h index as well as singlenumber alternatives have already been put forward. We examine in the present study the h index and the most important h index variants that have been proposed and discussed in the literature. The aim of the analysis is to determine empirically the extent to which the usage of the h index and its variants for measuring the performance of journals results in an incremental contribution against the Journal Impact Factor (J1F).

Using data from Angewandte Chemie International Edition (AC-IE), this study tested what would have happened if referee reports had been received in a different order. In AC-IE's peer-review process, a manuscript is generally published only if two referees rate the results of the study as important and also recommend publication in the journal (what we have called the 'clear-cut' rule). For 23% of those manuscripts for which a third referee report arrived after the editorial decision was made (37 of 162), this rule would have led to a different decision if the third report had replaced either of the others.

Analyses of citations for the set of papers returned by three fee-based databases - Science Citation Index, Scopus, and Chemical Abstracts - were compared to the analysis of citations found using GS data. Whereas the analyses using citations returned by the three fee-based databases show very similar results, the results of the analysis using GS citation data differed greatly from the findings using citations from the fee-based databases. Our study therefore supports, on the one hand, the convergent validity of citation analyses based on data from the fee-based databases and, on the other hand, the lack of convergent validity of the citation analysis based on the GS data.

The discovery of Dr. Hwang's fraud led to fierce criticism of the peer review process (at Science). To find answers to the question of why the journal peer review system did not detect scientific misconduct (falsification or fabrication of data) not only in the Hwang case but also in many other cases, an overview is needed of the criteria that editors and referees normally consider when reviewing a manuscript. Do they at all look for signs of scientific misconduct when reviewing a manuscript? We conducted a quantitative content analysis of 46 research studies that examined editors' and referees' criteria for the assessment of manuscripts and their grounds for accepting or rejecting manuscripts. The total of 572 criteria and reasons from the 46 studies could be assigned to nine main areas: (1) 'relevance of contribution,' (2) 'writing / presentation,' (3) 'design / conception,' (4) 'method / statistics,' (5) 'discussion of results,' (6) 'reference to the literature and documentation,' (7) 'theory,' (8) 'author's reputation / institutional affiliation,' and (9) 'ethics.' None of the criteria or reasons that were assigned to the nine main areas refers to or is related to possible falsification or fabrication of data. In a second step, the study examined what main areas take on high and low significance for editors and referees in manuscript assessment. The main areas that are clearly related to the quality of the research underlying a manuscript emerged in the analysis frequently as important: 'theory,' 'design / conception' and 'discussion of results.'

In order to answer this question we analyzed the Long-Term Fellowship and the Young Investigator programmes of the European Molecular Biology Organization. Both programmes aim to identify and support the best post doctoral fellows and young group leaders in the life sciences. We checked the association between the selection decisions and the scientific performance of the applicants. Our study involved publication and citation data for 668 applicants to the Long-Term Fellowship programme from the year 1998 (130 approved, 538 rejected) and 297 applicants to the Young Investigator programme (39 approved and 258 rejected applicants) from the years 2001 and 2002. If quantity and impact of research publications are used as a criterion for scientific achievement, the results of (zero-truncated) negative binomial models show that the peer review process indeed selects scientists who perform on a higher level than the rejected ones subsequent to application. We determined the extent of errors due to over-estimation (type I errors) and under-estimation (type 2 errors) of future scientific performance. Our statistical analyses point out that between 26% and 48% of the decisions made to award or reject an application show one of both error types. Even though for a part of the applicants, the selection committee did not correctly estimate the applicant's future performance, the results show a statistically significant association between selection decisions and the applicants' scientific achievements, if quantity and impact of research publications are used as a criterion for scientific achievement.

We investigated the journal peer-review process at Angewandte Chemie International Edition (AC-IE), one of the prime chemistry journals worldwide, and conducted a citation analysis for Communications that were accepted by the journal (n = 878) or rejected but published elsewhere (n = 959). The results of negative binomial-regression models show that holding all other model variables constant, being accepted by AC-IE increases the expected number of citations by up to 50%. A comparison of average citation counts (with 95% confidence intervals) of accepted and rejected (but published elsewhere) Communications with international scientific reference standards was undertaken. As reference standards, (a) mean citation counts for the journal set provided by Thomson Reuters corresponding to the field ""chemistry"" and (b) specific reference standards that refer to the subject areas of Chemical Abstracts were used. When compared to reference standards, the mean impact on chemical research is for the most part far above average not only for accepted Communications but also for rejected (but published elsewhere) Communications. However, average and below-average scientific impact is to be expected significantly less frequently for accepted Communications than for rejected Communications. All in all, the results of this study confirm that peer review at AC-IE is able to select the ""best"" scientific work with the highest impact on chemical research.",,"Bornmann, L., Daniel, H.-D., Selecting scientific excellence through committee peer review: A citation analysis of publications previously published to approval or rejection of postdoctoral research fellowship applicants (2006) Scientometrics, 68, pp. 427-440; Bommann, L., Daniel, H.-D., Convergent validation of peer review decisions using the h index: Extent of and reasons for type I and type II errors (2007) Journal of Informetrics, 1, pp. 204-213; Bornmann, L., Daniel, H.-D., Functional use of frequently and infrequently cited articles in citing publications.

Research on the grant peer review process that considers its multi-stage character scarcely exists. In this study we analyze 1954 applications for doctoral and post-doctoral fellowships from the Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds (B.I.F.), which are evaluated in three stages (first: evaluation by an external reviewer; second: internal evaluation by a staff member; third: final decision by the B.I.F. Board of Trustees). The results of a latent Markov model (in combination with latent class analysis) show that a fellowship application has a chance of approval only if it is recommended for support already in the first evaluation stage, that is, if the external reviewer's evaluation is positive. Based on these results, a form of triage or pre-screening of applications seems desirable. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Using comprehensive data sets of applicants to the long-term fellowship and young investigator programmes of the European Molecular Biology Organization, we determined the relationship between the h index and three (standard) bibliometric indicators (number of publications, total citation counts, and average journal impact factor) as well as peer assessments to test the convergent validity of the h index. The findings indicate that the h index is a valid indicator for research performance at micro and meso levels. Our results suggest that the h index is a promising rough measurement of the quality of a young scientist's work as it is judged by internationally renowned scientists.

The results of a factor analysis using bibliographic data on postdoctoral researchers in biomedicine indicate that regarding the h index and its variants, we are dealing with two types of indices that load on one factor each. One type describes the most productive core of a scientist's output and gives the number of papers in that core. The other type of indices describes the impact of the papers in the core. Because an index for evaluative purposes is a useful yardstick for comparison among scientists if the index corresponds strongly with peer assessments, we calculated a logistic regression analysis with the two factors resulting from the factor analysis as independent variables and peer assessment of the postdoctoral researchers as the dependent variable. The results of the regression analysis show that peer assessments can be predicted better using the factor 'impact of the productive core' than using the factor 'quantity of the productive core'.",,"Data point (2005) Science, 309 (5738), p. 1181. , Anon; Ball, P., Index aims for fair ranking of scientists (2005) Nature, 436 (7053), p. 900; Ball, P., Achievement index climbs the ranks (2007) Nature, 448 (7155), p. 737; Batista, P.D., Campiteli, M.G., Kinouchi, O., Is it possible to compare researchers with different scientific interests?

Based on the results of these studies, the paper seeks to answer the question of the extent to which scientists are motivated to cite a publication not only to acknowledge intellectual and cognitive influences of scientific peers, but also for other, possibly non-scientific, reasons. Design/methodology/approach - The review covers research published from the early 1960s up to mid-2005 (approximately 30 studies on citing behavior-reporting results in about 40 publications). Findings - The general tendency of the results of the empirical studies makes it clear that citing behavior is not motivated solely by the wish to acknowledge intellectual and cognitive influences of colleague scientists, since the individual studies reveal also other, in part non-scientific, factors that play a part in the decision to cite. However, the results of the studies must also be deemed scarcely reliable: the studies vary widely in design, and their results can hardly be replicated. Many of the studies have methodological weaknesses. Furthermore, there is evidence that the different motivations of citers are ""not so different or 'randomly given' to such an extent that the phenomenon of citation would lose its role as a reliable measure of impact"". Originality/value - Given the increasing importance of evaluative bibliometrics in the world of scholarship, the question ""What do citation counts measure?"" is a particularly relevant and topical issue.

E. (2005). An index to quantify an individual's scientific research output. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 102(46), 16569-16572] has proposed the h index as a single-number criterion to evaluate the scientific output of a researcher. We investigated the convergent validity of decisions for awarding long-term fellowships to post-doctoral researchers as practiced by the Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds (B.I.F.) by using the h index. Our study examined 414 B.I.F. applicants (64 approved and 350 rejected) with a total of 1586 papers. The results of our study show that the applicants' h indices correlate substantially with standard bibliometric indicators. Even though the h indices of approved B.I.F. applicants on average (arithmetic mean and median) are higher than those of rejected applicants (and with this, fundamentally confirm the validity of the funding decisions), the distributions of the h indices show in part overlaps that we categorized as type I error (falsely drawn approval) or type II error (falsely drawn rejection). Approximately, one-third of the decisions to award a fellowship to an applicant show a type I error, and about one-third of the decisions not to award a fellowship to an applicant show a type II error. Our analyses of possible reasons for these errors show that the applicant's field of study but not personal ties between the B.I.F. applicant and the B.I.F. can increase or decrease the risks for type I and type II errors.

Up to now, however, it has not been examined whether this strategy of ""multiple publication"" in fact leads to greater reception of the research. In the present study, we investigate the influence of number of articles reporting the results of a single study on reception in the scientific community (total citation counts of an article on a single study). Our data set consists of 96 applicants for a research fellowship from the Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds (BIF), an international foundation for the promotion of basic research in biomedicine. The applicants reported to us all articles that they had published within the framework of their doctoral research projects. On this single project, the applicants had published from 1 to 16 articles (M = 4; Mdn = 3). The results of a regression model with an interaction term show that the practice of multiple publication of research study results does in fact lead to greater reception of the research (higher total citation counts) in the scientific community. However, reception is dependent upon length of article: the longer the article, the more total citation counts increase with the number of articles. Thus, it pays for scientists to practice multiple publication of study results in the form of sizable reports.",,"Abt, H.A., Science, citation, and funding (1991) Science, 251 (5000), pp. 1408-1409; Abt, H.A., Institutional productivities (1993) Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 105 (689), pp. 794-798; Baker, M., Robertson, F., Toguchi, H., (1996) The australian postgraduate research award scheme: An evaluation of the 1990 cohort, , Canberra, Australia: Australian Government Publishing Service, Higher Education Division; Baldi, S., Normative versus social constructivist processes in the allocation of citations: A network-analytic model (1998) American Sociological Review, 63 (6), pp. 829-846; Beaver, D.B., Does collaborative research have greater epistemic authority?

In a comprehensive content analysis each reference to the B.I.F. article in the citing publication was classified according to two categories: 1) the location of the citation within the citing publication (section of the paper in which the citation appears) and 2) meaningful or cursory mentioning of the article in the citing publication. The results showed statistically significant differences between the B.I.F. applicants' articles with low or high citation counts. All in all, the results indicate that an article with high citation counts had greater relevance for the citing author than an article with low citation counts.","Citation; Citation behavior; Citation content analysis; Citation context analysis; Evaluative bibliometrics","Agresti, A., (2002) Categorical Data Analysis, , Hoboken, NJ, USA: John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Amsterdamska, O., Leydesdorff, L., Citations: Indicators of significance?

Since the evaluation of grants utilizes scientists with different personal attributes, it is natural to ask whether the norm of universalism reflects the actual evaluation practice. Subjects and methods: We investigated the influence of three attributes of external reviewers on their ratings in the selection procedure followed by the Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds (B.I.F.) for awarding long-term fellowships to doctoral and post-doctoral researchers in biomedicine: (i) number of applications assessed in the past for the B.I.F. (reviewers' evaluation experience), (ii) the reviewers' country of residence and (iii) the reviewers' gender. To analyze the reviewers' ratings (1: award; 2: maybe award; 3: no award) in an ordinal regression model (ORM) the following were considered in addition to the three attributes: (i) the scientific achievements of the fellowship applicants, (ii) interaction effects between reviewers' and applicants' attributes and (iii) judgmental tendencies of reviewers. Results: The results of the model estimations show no significant effect of the reviewers' attributes on the evaluation of B.I.F. fellowship applications. The ratings of the external reviewers are mainly determined by the applicants' scientific achievement prior to application. Conclusions: The results suggest that the external reviewers of the B.I.F. indeed achieved the foundation's goal of recommending applicants with higher scientific achievement for fellowships and of recommending those with lower scientific achievement for rejection.

Assessing the validity of selection decisions requires a generally accepted criterion for research impact. A widely used approach is to use citation counts as a proxy for the impact of scientific research. Therefore, a citation analysis for articles published previous to the applicants' approval or rejection for a B.I.F. fellowship was conducted. Based on our model estimation (negative binomial regression model), journal articles that had been published by applicants approved for a fellowship award (n = 64) prior to applying for the B.I.F. fellowship award can be expected to have 37% (straight counts of citations) and 49% (complete counts of citations) more citations than articles that had been published by rejected applicants (n = 333). Furthermore, comparison with international scientific reference values revealed (a) that articles published by successful and non-successful applicants are cited considerably more often than the ""average"" publication and (b) that excellent research performance can be expected more of successful than non-successful applicants. The findings confirm that the foundation is not only achieving its goal of selecting the best junior scientists for fellowship awards, but also successfully attracting highly talented young scientists to apply for B.I.F. fellowships.

As studies in Europe and beyond show that multi-stage evaluation procedures as the main quality assurance instrument for evaluation of teaching and learning in higher education institutions have proved reliable and have gained acceptance, in Germany (as well as in other countries) the evaluation of teaching and learning through internal and external evaluations has long come under the fire of criticism. Our results of the first comprehensive and representative investigation of procedures for the evaluation of teaching and learning in Germany show that former participants in the evaluations (reviewers and those reviewed) are satisfied all in all with the multi-stage procedure. They are convinced that the goals of quality assurance and improvement were achieved. Suggestions for improving the procedures target individual aspects, such as, for example, the composition of the review panel. Against this background, it makes sense to perform regular quality assessments of the procedures for quality assurance and improvement.

Assessing the validity of selection decisions requires a generally accepted criterion for research impact. A widely used approach is to use citation counts as a proxy for the impact of scientific research. Therefore, a citation analysis for articles published previous to the applicants' approval or rejection for a B.I.F. fellowship was conducted. Based on our model estimation (negative binomial regression model), journal articles that had been published by applicants approved for a fellowship award (n=64) prior to applying for the B.I.F. fellowship award can be expected to have 37% (straight counts of citations) and 49% (complete counts of citations) more citations than articles that had been published by rejected applicants (n=333). Furthermore, comparison with international scientific reference values revealed (a) that articles published by successful and non-successful applicants are cited considerably more often than the ""average"" publication and (b) that excellent research performance can be expected more of successful than non-successful applicants. The findings confirm that the foundation is not only achieving its goal of selecting the best junior scientists for fellowship awards, but also successfully attracting highly talented young scientists to apply for B.I.F. fellowships.",,"Balaban, A.T., How should citations to articles in high- and low-impact journals be evaluated, or what is a citation worth?

The most important aspect of our study was to investigate the predictive validity of the procedure, i.e. whether the foundation achieves its aim to select as fellowship recipients the best junior scientists. Our bibliometric analysis shows that this is indeed the case and that the selection procedure is thus highly valid. With regard to fairness of the procedure, we analysed the extent to which the foundation's Board of Trustees' practice of reviewing the applications in alphabetic order when making final selection decisions has an influence on the decisions that they make. A statistically significant influence of the postulated bias variable could be observed, but the effect size was small.

The analyses are based on a questionnaire survey (n = 2 244) among doctoral degree holders achieving the doctoral degree in six selected disciplines (biology, electrical engineering, German studies, mathematics, social sciences, and business studies/ economics) at German universities. In terms of our first object of investigation, the analyses show that in four out of six disciplines doctoral degree holders are a selected group compared to university graduates with regard to both social origin and gender. In terms of our second object of investigation - the impact of particularistic attributes on several indicators of further career attainment after achieving the doctoral degree (career inside or outside higher education and science, career position and income) - the results point to a stronger impact of gender compared to social origin.",,"Allmendinger, J., Fuchs, S., Von Stebut, J., DrehtÃ¼r oder Pater Noster?
