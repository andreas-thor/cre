		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			Which are the most important papers in the history of a field? On
			whose shoulders of giants does an author stand? Where to look for the
			intellectual roots of a research topic? These questions can be
			answered by using the program CitedReferencesExplorer (CRExplorer).
			The CRExplorer is a new software development which is based on the
			programs provided at 
			<a href="http://www.leydesdorff.net/software/rpys/">Loet Leydesdorff’s homepage</a>.
		</p>
		<p>The CRExplorer uses data from Web of Science (Thomson Reuters)
			as input. Publication sets have to be downloaded including the
			references cited. The program focusses on the analysis of the cited
			references, in particular on the referenced publication years. Over
			time, "citation classics" of a field become more pronounced. When the
			aggregated citations are plotted along the time axis, one obtains a
			"spectrogram" with peaks. CRExplorer visualizes this spectrogram,
			cleans the cited references (so-called "disambiguation"), and uses a
			smoothing algorithm to suppress the noise.</p>

		  	<img src="fig1.png" alt="Figure 1">
  			<figcaption><i>Figure 1: Three citation classics of “climate change” appearing as peaks in the spectrogram</i></figcaption>
		</figure> 

		<p>Figure 1, for example, shows three pronounced peaks during the
			19th century, and a few smaller ones during the first half of the
			20th century. We first downloaded from the Web of Science 1,413
			publications containing "carbon dioxide" and "climate" as title
			words. These papers contain 35,679 references to publications
			published during 133 years. The graph produced by the CRExplorer
			shows three distinct peaks in 1861, 1896, and 1899, respectively.</p>

		<p>These three peaks go back to the following publications:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Tyndall's (1861) paper, entitled "On the absorption and
				radiation of heat by gases and vapours, and on the physical
				connexion of radiation, absorption, and conduction", proved that the
				earth's atmosphere has a greenhouse effect and concluded that water
				vapour is the principal gas controlling air temperature.</li>
			<li>Arrhenius (1896, entitled "On the influence of carbonic acid
				in the air upon the temperature of the ground") was the first study
				with a calculation of how changes in the levels of carbon dioxide in
				the atmosphere can alter the surface temperature through the
				greenhouse effect.</li>
			<li>Chamberlin's (1899) study, entitled "An attempt to frame a
				working hypothesis of the cause of glacial periods on an atmospheric
				basis", argued that the glacial periods could result from changes in
				the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In sum, the discovery of the earth’s greenhouse effect and the
			role of carbon dioxide and water vapor as greenhouse gases are no
			recent findings but date back to the second half of the nineteenth
			century.

		<h1>Running CRExplorer & System Requirements</h1>
		<p>CRExplorer requires a system with Java 7 support. There are two
			options to run CRExplorer:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Java Web Start</b>: Click the 
				<a	href="http://www1.hft-leipzig.de/thor/crexplorer/CitedReferencesExplorer.jnlp">CRExplorer Start link</a> 
				to launch CRExplorer directly from this web page using
				Java Web Start Launcher. If you start CRExplorer for the first time
				your computer system will likely refuse to run the program due to
				security reasons. If so, you have to put the URL 
				<a href="http://www1.hft-leipzig.de">http://www1.hft-leipzig.de</a> in
				the list of exceptions in your Java configuration. Please follow the
				official Java instructions on <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/exception_sitelist.xml">
				How can I configure the Exception Site List?</a>. This has to be done only
				once.<br />
			<br /></li>
			<li><b>Download</b>: You can <a
				href="http://www1.hft-leipzig.de/thor/crexplorer/CitedReferencesExplorerFull.jar">download
				a runnable JAR file</a>. On most systems a double click on the JAR file
				will start CRExplorer. If you want to run the JAR file from command
				line please refer to the official Java documentation on <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/run.html">
				Running JAR-Packaged Software</a>. Here you can also set the heap space size if
				you are processing large files.</li>
