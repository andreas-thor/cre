		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>Which are the most important papers in the history of a field?
			On whose shoulders of giants does an author stand? Where to look for
			the intellectual roots of a research topic? These questions can be
			answered by using the program CitedReferencesExplorer (CRExplorer).</p>

		<p>The CRExplorer uses data from Web of Science (Clarivate
			Analytics) or Scopus (Elsevier) as input. Publication sets have to be
			downloaded including the references cited. The program focusses on
			the analysis of the cited references, in particular on the referenced
			publication years. Over time, "citation classics" of a field become
			more pronounced. When the aggregated citations are plotted along the
			time axis, one obtains a "spectrogram" with distinct peaks.
			CRExplorer visualizes this spectrogram, cleans the cited references
			(so-called "disambiguation"), and uses a smoothing algorithm to
			suppress the noise.</p>


		<p>
			The method Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RPYS) was
			developed by Werner Marx, who used it for the first time in the field
			of meteorology (<a
				href="http://www.rmets.org/sites/default/files/hisnews1003.pdf">see
				his study on page 11</a>). For demonstration of the potential of the
			method, figure 1 shows the citation classics concerning the discovery
			of the “greenhouse effect”, a basic component of climate change.
		</p>

		<figure style="display: table; float: left;">

				<i>Figure 1: Citation classics concerning the discovery of the
					“greenhouse effect” and appearing as peaks in the spectrogram
					provided by the CRExplorer.</i>
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>We downloaded from the Web of Science 3,244 publications
			containing the term "greenhouse effect” in the title or in the
			abstract or as a keyword. These papers contain 81,126 references to
			publications published over 379 years. The graph produced by the
			CRExplorer shows three distinct peaks during the 19th century and a
			few others during the first half of the 20th century.</p>

		<p>The first three pronounced peaks go back to the following
			publications:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Fourier’s 1827 paper, entitled "Mémoire sur les températures
				du globe terrestre et des espaces planétaires", can be seen as the
				first decisive publication. Fourier found that the earth is warmer
				than expected. He attributed this to the phenomenon that the earth’s
				atmosphere is transparent for solar radiation but not for the
				infrared radiation from the ground. Thus, he discovered the
				(natural) greenhouse effect.</li>
			<li>Tyndall's (1861) study, entitled "On the absorption and
				radiation of heat by gases and vapours, and on the physical
				connexion of radiation, absorption, and conduction", proved that the
				earth's atmosphere has a greenhouse effect. He concluded that water
				vapour is the principal gas controlling air temperature.</li>
			<li>Arrhenius (1896, entitled "On the influence of carbonic acid
				in the air upon the temperature of the ground") published the first
				study with a calculation of how changes in the levels of carbon
				dioxide in the atmosphere can alter the surface temperature through
				the greenhouse effect.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>The subsequently following peaks can be assigned to the works
			of Chamberlin (1898), Arrhenius (1908), and Callendar (1938, 1949).
			These are citation classics in the climate change literature. They
			deal with the possibility that climatic change results from changes
			in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide—thereby supporting
			the calculationtheory of Arrhenius. Whereas Chamberlin (1898) and
			Callendar (1938, 1949) have been written for scientists, Arrhenius
			(1908) book was directed at a general audience.</p>

		<p>
			In sum, the discovery of the earth’s greenhouse effect and the role
			of carbon dioxide and water vapor as greenhouse gases are no recent
			findings but date back to the beginning of the nineteenth century.

		<h1>Running CRExplorer &amp; System Requirements</h1>
		<p>CRExplorer requires a system with Java 8 support. There are two
			options to run CRExplorer in the GUI mode:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Java Web Start</b>: Click the <a
				href="http://www1.hft-leipzig.de/thor/crexplorer/CitedReferencesExplorer.jnlp">CRExplorer
					Start link</a> to launch CRExplorer directly from this web page using
				Java Web Start Launcher. If you start CRExplorer for the first time
				your computer system will likely refuse to run the program due to
				security reasons. If so, you have to put the URL <a
				href="http://www1.hft-leipzig.de">http://www1.hft-leipzig.de</a> in
				the list of exceptions in your Java configuration. Please follow the
				official Java instructions on <a
				href="https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/exception_sitelist.xml">
					How can I configure the Exception Site List?</a>. This has to be done
				only once.<br /> <br /></li>
			<li><b>Download</b>: You can <a
				href="http://www1.hft-leipzig.de/thor/crexplorer/CitedReferencesExplorerFull.jar">download
					a runnable JAR file</a>. On most systems a double click on the JAR file
				will start CRExplorer. If you want to run the JAR file from command
				line please refer to the official Java documentation on <a
				href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/run.html">
					Running JAR-Packaged Software</a>. Here you can also set the heap space
				size if you are processing large files.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			If you want to employ CRExplorer's script language, you can <a
				href="http://www1.hft-leipzig.de/thor/crexplorer/CitedReferencesExplorerScript.jar">download
				a runnable JAR file</a> that can be started from the command line as
			follows:
		
		<pre>java -jar CitedReferencesExplorerScript.jar [myscript.crs]</pre>
		where [myscript.crs] should be replaced by the user's script filename.
		</p>


		<h2>Releases</h2>

		<p>CRExplorer version 1.8.2 was released on February 1, 2018. This
			version includes the following new features and improvements:</p>
		<ul>

			<li><b>Sequence</b>: To reveal impact sequences over time for
				cited references, cited references are classified as on average
				("0"), above average ("+"), and below average ("-") citation impact
				in citing years. The benchmark is the mean citation impact of all
				other cited references published in the same year. For example, the
				sequence [---+++000] means that the cited reference has been cited
				below average in the first three citing years, above average in the
				next three years, and on average in the last three citing years.</li>
			<li><b>Types of sequences</b>: The sequences are used to
				identify specific types in terms of the symbols ("+", "-", "0"). The
				types are labelled as follows: <i>sleeping beauty</i> with low or no
				citation impact over a longer initial period and high citation
				impact later; <i>constant performer</i> with a constant and
				considerable amount of citation impact over time; <i>hot paper</i>
				with high citation impact directly after the publication and low
				citation impact later; <i>life cycle</i> with very different
				citation impact across the citing years.</li>
			<li><b>Samples</b>: In many cases, the full dataset from Web of
				Science or Scopus (the population) cannot be completely imported in
				the program because the available memory on the computer is
				restricted. Thus, the user has the new option to reduce the dataset
				by loading only a sample from the population. Three samples can be
				drawn from the population: <i>random</i>, <i>systematic</i>, or <i>cluster
					sample</i>.</li>
			<li><b>Script language</b>: CRExplorer provides a tailored
				script language that allows the application of the most important
				functions. This can be useful for recurring experiments using different 
				data sets or for processing large volumes of data. 
				Users can execute scripts from the command line. The use of the script language
				is explained in the handbook.
				</li>
		</ul>
		<p>CRExplorer version 1.7.7 was released on June 30, 2017. This
			version includes the following new features and improvements:</p>
		<ul>

			<li><b>Publications</b>: Users can specify (under "File" -
				"Settings" - "Import/Export") if CRExplorer should include
				publications that do not have any cited references.</li>
			<li><b>Settings</b>: Several enhancements in the settings incl.
				chart layout options (font size, stroke size).</li>
		</ul>

		<p>CRExplorer version 1.7.5 was released on May 31, 2017. This
			version includes the following new features and improvements:</p>
		<ul>

			<li><b>Citing Publications</b>: Users can inspect the list of
				citing publications for selected cited references via "View" -
				"Citing Publications".</li>
			<li><b>Searching</b>: Users can do keyword searches for cited
				references (including wildcards such as *).</li>
			<li><b>Indicators</b>: Three indicators are included which show
				in how many citing years the cited publication (cited reference)
				belongs to the 50%, 25%, or 10% most cited publications – compared
				to all other cited publications (cited references) which have been
				appeared in the same cited year.</li>
			<li><b>CSV output formats</b>: CRExplorer offers different
				CSV-based output formats (graph data, cited references and/or citing
				publications)</li>
			<li><b>Copy + Paste</b>: Users can copy selected cited
				references to clipboard (Ctrl+C) and paste it in other programs
				(e.g., Excel).</li>
			<li><b>New Chart layout</b>: Beside the standard chart
				(JFreeChart), CRExplorer now employs a new web-based, interactive
				chart type (HighCharts). Users can switch between the types in the
				"File" - "Settings" menu.</li>
			<li><b>User Interface</b>: CRExplorer's GUI is now based on
				JavaFX.</li>
			<li><b>Handbook</b>: A <a href="manual.pdf">handbook</a> is
				available which explains the elements and functions of the program.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>CRExplorer version 1.6.8 was released on August 29, 2016. This
			version includes the following new features and improvements:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Co-Citation</b>: If the user marks at least one cited
				reference in the table and selects “Data” – “Retain Publications
				Citing Selected Cited References”, all cited references which are
				co-cited with the marked cited reference in citing publications are
				kept (all other cited references are dropped). See <a
				href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07960">Which early works are
					cited most frequently in climate change research literature? A
					bibliometric approach based on Reference Publication Year
					Spectroscopy</a> for a first use case.</li>
			<li><b>Performance</b>: Performance improvements (e.g., for data
				clustering) using multiple threads on multi-core machines.</li>
			<li><b>Java 8</b>: CRExplorer requires a Java 8 run-time.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>
			CRExplorer version 1.6.7 was released on July 5, 2016. This version
			includes the following new features and improvements (see <a
				href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01266">New features of
				CRExplorer</a> for a detailed description):
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Scopus</b>: Using “File” – “Import” – “Scopus”,
				CRExplorer reads files from Scopus. The file format “CSV” (including
				citations, abstracts and references) should be chosen in Scopus for
				downloading records.</li>
			<li><b>Export facilities</b>: Using “File” – “Export” –
				“Scopus”, CRExplorer exports files in the Scopus format. Using
				“File” – “Export” – “Web of Science”, CRExplorer exports files in
				the Web of Science format. These files can be imported in other
				bibliometric programs (e.g. VOSviewer).</li>
			<li><b>Space bar</b>: Select a specific cited reference in the
				cited references table, press the space bar, and all bibliographic
				details of the CR are shown.</li>
			<li><b>Internal file format</b>: Using “File” – “Save”, working
				files are saved in the internal file format “*.cre”. The files
				include all data including matching results and manual matching
				corrections. The files can be opened by using “File” – “Open”.</li>
