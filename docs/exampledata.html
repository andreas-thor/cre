			<h1>Landmark publications by Web of Science subject categories

				What are the landmark papers in scientific fields? On which
				shoulders does research in these fields stand? Which papers are
				indispensable for scientific progress?

			<div id="readMore" style="display: none"> 
			<p >These are typical
				questions which are not only of interest for researchers (who
				frequently know the answers – or are supposed to know them), but
				also for the general public (e.g., science journalists). Citation
				counts are often used to identify very useful papers, since they
				reflect the wisdom of crowd – the many scientists using the
				published results for their own research. We identified with
				recently developed methods for the program CRExplorer landmark
				publications in (nearly) all Web of Science (WoS, Clarivate
				Analytics) subject categories (WoSSCs). These are publications which
				belong more frequently than other publications to the top-‰ in their
				WoSSC across the citing years. We used the WoS custom data of the
				Max Planck Society’s in-house database derived from the Science
				Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E), Social Sciences Citation Index
				(SSCI), and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI) produced by
				Clarivate Analytics (Philadelphia, USA). All records (especially
				cited references) for the papers of the document type "article"
				published between 1980 and 2017 were exported and analyzed
				separately for each WoSSC (except "Multidisciplinary Sciences"). We
				considered only the 204 WoSSCs with a proportion of at least 30%
				linked cited references among all cited references. The reason is
				that only WoSSCs with a sufficient paper coverage in WoS should be
				considered in the analyses. The 10 papers of each WoSSC which belong
				most frequently to the top-‰ across the citing years can be found in
				the table below. A detailed explanation of the methods used for
				identifying the landmark papers can be found at [LINK WILL BE
				AVAILABLE SOON].
